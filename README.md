## Pet Adoption Website

In this project, I practiced using React Router to add client-side routing to a React Application.  

Specifically, I built a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

* Note: This application was created using Create React App and is written using React Router v5.
